# Instructions :
# The goal is to create a class that represents a simple circle.
# A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter.
# The user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter.

# Other abilities of a Circle instance:

# Compute the circleâ€™s area
# Print the attributes of the circle - use a dunder method
# Be able to add two circles together, and return a new circle with the new radius - use a dunder method
# Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger, and return a Boolean - use a dunder method
# Be able to compare two circles and see if there are equal, and return a Boolean- use a dunder method
# Be able to put them in a list and sort them
# Bonus (not mandatory) : Install the Turtle module, and draw the sorted circles
import turtle
