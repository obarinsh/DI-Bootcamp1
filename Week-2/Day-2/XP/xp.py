# üåü Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:

# class Pets():
#     def __init__(self, animals):
#         self.animals = animals

#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:
#             print(animal.walk())


# class Cat():
#     is_lazy = True

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

#     def walk(self):
#         return f'{self.name} is just walking around'


# class Bengal(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# class Siamese(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# cat1 = Bengal('lola', 4)
# cat2 = Chartreux('mishell', 12)
# cat3 = Siamese('leticia', 3)

# all_cats = [cat1, cat2, cat3]
# sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)

# sara_pets.walk()

# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.


# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight.
# The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

# class Dog():
#     def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.
